# GML Tasks

Maintained by: Seabass

This framework allows for you to create and execute tasks in a semi-asynchronous fashion. The system will iterate through tasks while maintaining the user-defined minimum framerate. This can be used for a great many things including but not limited to...

 - Loading/processing large amounts of data
 - Solving complicated math or logic such as flood fill
 - AI processing
 - World generation
 - Raytracing
 - The entire framework is GML-based and requires no DLLs or external assets.

These scripts are for GMS 2 only!
